**Data Analytics Portfolio**

This repository showcases a collection of data analytics projects where I apply various techniques such as data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to derive insights from complex datasets. Each project demonstrates my proficiency in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools like Power BI. Key highlights include exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and creating interactive dashboards. These projects reflect my ability to turn raw data into actionable insights, supporting data-driven decision-making.
